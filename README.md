## STRUCTURE
- In 2019, I explored this dataset as part of a grad school project.
-- 2019_Project tracks that work and includes my paper
- In 2022, I returned to this project for a second look, again with Logistic Regression.
-- 2022_Project tracks the ongoing edits to the project, including new tools.

## TO UNDERSTAND THIS PROJECT
- Start by opening the 2019_Project and check out the PDF grad paper. This walks through the entire 2019 project.
- The 2022 revisit is a recreation of some of the same methodology and further exploration of prior topics.

## TO REPLICATE
- The 2019 Project is an older version of this code and may not be immediately replicable.
-- Please refer to the 2019 Paper in 2019_Project for a description of work and outcomes.
- The 2022 Project can be replicated by:
-- Downloading the Data Source (below)
-- Using Anaconda 2022.05 or later
-- Using Python 3.9.12 or later
